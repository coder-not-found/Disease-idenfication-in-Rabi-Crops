# Disease Identification in Rabi Crops
 
Worked on building models for "Disease Detection in Rabi crop", to build an effective mechanism to be adopted for food security and its production. Due to infections caused by pests like virus, fungus and bacteria, there is a huge loss in quality and quantity of the rice. This results in a huge loss to the farmers. There is a need for more advanced techniques to automate the system effectively and efficiently. \
Achieved the maximum testing accuracy of 97.41%. <br>

Models Worked on: \
•	CNN \
•	Vgg 16 \
•	ResNet \
•	DenseNet \
•	AlexNet \
•	Inception V3
